Summary:
I created this for the Front End Wed Developer Nano Degree - Click Clicker pro version in the P5 section of the class.

TODO:
I cannot get the ADMIN secion to appear in a nice place regarless of the screen width.  I tried using the jquery thing but after messing with it for awhile I realize that I need to move on to the next section and the actual project before I spend another month messaing around..

Thanks and have a nice day.
